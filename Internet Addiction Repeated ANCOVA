# --- SEM MEDIATION ANALYSIS ---
# Hypothesized model:
# "Among adolescents with problematic internet use (PIU), those who received ICBT treatment will show a significant decrease in loneliness and social anxiety, 
# and this emotional improvement will lead to a significant reduction in PIU, mediated by preference for online social interaction (POSI)."
#
# In this mediation model, we use follow-up scores (adjusted by ANCOVA) to test the indirect effects:
#   - Loneliness and social anxiety influence POSI,
#   - POSI in turn influences PIU.
# We also include direct paths from loneliness and social anxiety to PIU.

mediation_model <- '
  # Paths from emotional measures to mediator (POSI)
  POSI_follow ~ a1*loneliness_follow + a2*social_anxiety_follow

  # Path from mediator to outcome (PIU)
  PIU_follow ~ b*POSI_follow

  # Direct effects on PIU
  PIU_follow ~ c1*loneliness_follow + c2*social_anxiety_follow

  # Indirect effects
  indirect_loneliness := a1 * b
  indirect_social := a2 * b

  # Total effects
