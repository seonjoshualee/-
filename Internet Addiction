# --- SEM Mediation Analysis ---
# Hypothesized SEM: 
#   1. Treatment predicts emotional improvement (latent variable from loneliness_change and social_anxiety_change).
#   2. Emotional improvement predicts POSI_change.
#   3. POSI_change predicts PIU_change.
#
# This tests whether the effect of treatment on PIU reduction is mediated by improvements in emotion
# (decreases in loneliness and social anxiety) that, in turn, lead to a reduction in POSI and thus PIU.
sem_model <- '
  # Latent variable for emotional improvement (higher change = greater improvement)
  emotional_improvement =~ loneliness_change + social_anxiety_change
  
  # Structural regressions
  emotional_improvement ~ a*group_num
  POSI_change ~ b*emotional_improvement
  PIU_change ~ c*POSI_change + d*group_num
  
  # Indirect (mediated) effect of treatment on PIU_change via emotional_improvement and POSI_change
  indirect := a * b * c
  
  # Total effect includes the direct effect of treatment and the indirect effect
  total := d + (a * b * c)
'

fit_sem <- sem(sem_model, data = data, se = "bootstrap", bootstrap = 1000)
summary(fit_sem, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)

# The output will show parameter estimates for each path.
# In particular, check that:
# - The path 'a' (group -> emotional_improvement) is significant (indicating that ICBT treatment leads to emotional improvement),
# - The path 'b' (emotional_improvement -> POSI_change) is significant,
# - The path 'c' (POSI_change -> PIU_change) is significant,
# - And the computed 'indirect' effect is significant.
